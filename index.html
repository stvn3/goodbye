You already know.<br><br>But I'm just here to say: thank you. Thank you to all of you who were there for me and supported me in that tough time, I want you all to know that i appreciate every single one of you and that I'm glad I could make some great memories.<br>I have given away all of my accounts. My youtube channel and other social medias i have are in good hands now. <br><br>I really tried my best to not do all of this but I had no other choice. I couldnt find a better solution for this pain.<br><br>Once again, thank you for everything. I love all of you.<br>My suffering has come to an end.<br><br>Revelation 21:4 nlt.<br><br>love these people the most:<br><br>isla,<br>william,<br>mina,<br>zan,<br>alya,<br>evie,<br>zuzia.";
